# VkMirror

Allows you to sync all your vk dialogs to telegram

Currently sync with one bot is working fine (using groups to make multiple chats with single bot), but this looks awful:
- In group every message has bot name
- If vk chat has multiple people every message has to contain a name, I found no good way to display it
- Bot has single icon everywhere

Best solution would be to have bot for every person in vk, but this requires auto registration through @BotFather.

Also, there is limit of bot count per telegram account (~10), so I am looking for telegram account source.

I probably can use some service with free sms numbers, but this will require a lot of work creating accounts, and I'm not currently interested in doing this.
